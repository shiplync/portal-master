  <h2>Company divisions</h2> 
  <p>Use divisions to segment your company into separate groups of people. Carriers might create a division for each terminal. Brokers might create a division for each branch of the brokerage. Assign supervisors to divisions and make them able to assign freight to other members of the division.</p>
